Functionality: 
There are now 2 new editor hotkeys. The first one, ctrl+4, is for toggling the editing of light-related objects. (Similar to how ctrl+1/2/3 toggle the editing of static objects/decals/gameplay objects).
The second one, currently set to "g", acts as a second input for rotating the editor cam - since using left-click while in a crowded space can cause one to accidently select/move around stuff even though they only wanted to rotate the camera.
Note: Honestly not too sure where I stand on what the button should be for this one. I just chose "g" since, as far as I know, "g" isn't used for anything else editor-wise but it's still close to the WASD keys.



Implementation:
The ctrl+4 hotkey is implemented in the same way that ctrl+1/2/3 are, and the "g" hotkey works because now, in cam.as, it does editor cam rotation stuffs if "mouse0" is down *or* if "g" is down.

To get the "ctrl+4" hotkey to work, I had to "define" it in the config file.
Um, I suppose this is the part where I mention that I actually have no idea how this config file stuff works. At first I was thinking that one of the source files is probably responsible for writing all the default hotkeys and binds and what have you there, but I couldn't find anything (entirely possible I just missed it somewhere) - so now I'm thinking that maybe what's supposed to be written in that config file is shipped with the game? Like, when you install it, that stuff gets put there? I have no idea. 



Reason For Existing:
The ctrl+4 hotkey exists for consistency's sake and, because, if the suggestions I mentioned in my "editor hotkey and view ribbon fixes" PR are implemented then this'd just be pretty cool.
The "g" hotkey exists as Constance requested it in the GitHub issues thing and I liked the sound of it.

So... On that note, I do actually have a question/suggestion:
Perhaps when the "g" hotkey is used, not only does it allow you to rotate the editor cam without worry of selecting/moving stuff, but maybe it also disables the editor UI/bounding boxes/hotspot connections/etc. while the key is held down too? 
It would just add another function to this hotkey which I personally think would be really cool.

Whenever I'm making maps, I *very* frequently jump into Media Mode just so I can see what the map "really looks like" so far (even in the early stages of development when clutter is at a minimum), but I also get that I may be in the minority about this and that for others, the disappearing/reappearing of the editor UI/bounding boxes/etc. can be a nuisance. 



Bonus Attatched:
My config file. The new hotkey stuff can be found with a ctrl+f for "toggle_light_editing".



Testing:
â€¢ Hopped into a couple different levels, pressed the buttons and saw if they did the thing. 
They did indeed do the thing, and they didn't interfere with any of the other hotkeys or editor functionality from what I saw.
