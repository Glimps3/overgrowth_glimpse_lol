Changed Files:
overgrowth-main\Source\Editors\map_editor.cpp



Functionality: 
While in Media Mode, all editor tools functionality is disabled.
This includes making selections, adding to selections, selecting/deselecting all, scroll select, ctrl+c/x/v, etc.
To kinda be more exact about what's disabled in Media Mode - All editor transform tool stuff, and all editor keyboard shortcuts.



Implementation:
In the If-Statements where it checks whether or not it should do a certain editor thing, I just added "&& not_in_media_mode_lol"
For example, the Select All feature used to look like: if (KeyCommand::CheckPressed(keyboard, KeyCommand::kSelectAll, KIMF_LEVEL_EDITOR_GENERAL))
And now it looks like: if (!Graphics::Instance()->media_mode() && KeyCommand::CheckPressed(keyboard, KeyCommand::kSelectAll, KIMF_LEVEL_EDITOR_GENERAL))
Rinse-Repeat for all the yams.



Reason For Existing:
Still being able to select/change stuff while in Media Mode sucked (especially 'cause you couldn't see your cursor), and is almost definitely not intended behaviour.



Testing:
• Tested on a large variety of levels, both pre-existing and newly created.

• Tested with having no selections before entering Media Mode, and then trying to select using the mouse (double-left-clicking stuff) and keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+a
  while in Media Mode.

• Tested with having some things or all things selected before entering Media Mode, and then trying to add to the selection (shift+left-click), copy/cut, deselect all, move/scale/rotate the selection, etc.

• Tested with selecting and copying a selection before entering Media Mode, and then trying to paste that selection while in Media Mode.
