Functionality: 
There is now a checkbox next to "Edit decals" in the editor ribbon named "Edit shadows".
This new checkbox allow you to toggle the editing of shadow decals independently of all other decals.



Implementation:
(Apologies about my phrasing of things if it's incorrect.)

DecalObjects can now have a "flag parameter" in their .xml file called "is_shadow". 
Setting this flag to true, will result in that particular DecalObject returning a value of _shadow_decal_object when GetType() is called on that object (whereas DecalObjects that don't have that flag param *or* have it set to false will return _decal_object as they normally did).
This allows the editing of those objects to be toggled independently of other DecalObjects when SetTypeEnabled is called.

Throughout the rest of the code, I made sure that in instances where Objects of type _decal_object were treated differently, that all Objects of 
type _shadow_decal_objects would get that same treatment.
This ensures that Shadow Decals still behave and function exactly the same as they did before, and that the *only* change is that they can now be
independently toggled.



Reason For Existing:
In my experience, Shadow decals can get/have gotten in the way of placing/re-arranging Other decals or vice versa depending on which pass was done
first. This is especially prevalent in interior scenes like caves that have a lot of both types of decals.



Bonus Attatched:
A screenshot showing where the new checkbox is.
Files of the round and square Shadow decals that have the "is_shadow" param and have it set to true.



Testing:
• Tested on a large variety of levels, both pre-existing and newly created.

• Tested that Shadow decals can only be selected when their checkbox is on, that Other decals can be selected when their checkbox is on, that both
  can be selected when both checkboxes are on and that neither can be selected when neither checkbox is on.

• Tested that Shadow decals are all properly deselected when their checkbox is turned off, and the same for Other decals.

• Tested that placing, re-arranging, deleting and pressing ctrl+z or ctrl+shift+z all work for Shadow decals.

• Tested that loading into, saving and exiting a level that has these Shadow decals doesn't cause any problems.

• Tested that the Color Picker works correctly and as expected for these Shadow decals.

• Tested that ctrl+a and ctrl+shift+a works correctly for both Shadow and Other decals.
