Functionality: 
Allows one to add a param to an attacks .xml file that will increase or decrease the hitbox range of that attack.



Implementation:
An attack's .xml file can now have a new float param called "range_adjust".

In the aschar.as file, whether or not an attack's .xml has this param can be gotten from attack_getter.HasRangeAdjust(), and the value of the param can be gotten from 
attack_getter.GetRangeAdjust().

The first function just ensures that no problems are caused for the pre-existing .xml files that don't have this param.

The value that the second function returns will be added to (or, I guess, subtracted from if the value is negative) the distance check performed in
HandleAnimationCombatEvent(). This allows one to have finer control over how close the player (or any character) has to be to their opponent for a particular attack of
theirs to hit.

The reason I chose the method of adding to/subtracting from the range of an attack, instead of out-right overriding it, is because with this method it's really easy to look at an attack in-game and think "This could use a lil' bit more/less range." and so add or subtract from it respectively.

Note: This only adjusts the *hitbox* range of a particular attack, and not from how far away someone must be to an opponent in order for an attack to trigger in the 
first place.



Reason For Existing:
Constance mentioned goofy range being a problem with the upper-cut attack in the Drowned Set she made for Ouruin - so this fixes that.
It's also just a pretty cool thing for modders generally speaking, both for giving them more freedom and for balancing goofy hitboxes wherever they are.



Example of what the new .xml param-thing looks like:
<range_adjust val="-0.5"/>



Bonus Attatched:
Some attack .xml files that have the range_adjust param. It's somewhat hard to tell the difference with the roundhouse.xmls, but with the spear attack .xmls (which all set the
total range to some negative number) it's easy to tell that they're working as using a spear to fight someone else with a spear will result in both of your attacks 
constantly missing. 



Testing:
• Tested on a large variety of attacks, including weapon attacks and on all 5 species.

• Tested with having an absurdly high range_adjust value, and an absurdly low range_adjust value. 
  (Note: Having an absurdly low range-adjust value (i.e. one that makes the total range have a negative value) will cause the attack to always miss. This is because 
  distance cannot be negative, so the distance between some guy and their opponent will always be more than the attack range value. It should also be noted that these attacks,
  like any that's not in range, can't be blocked.)
