Functionality: 
You can no longer select the sun when it's behind any selectable object, provided the type for that object (static mesh/decal/gameplay object/lighting) is currently editor enabled. 

If the sun is *already* selected, however, and you attempt to reposition it/change intensity/change colour while it's behind an enabled selectable object, then you *can indeed* do that. I chose this because I found that, when trying to position the sun, if I accidently moved it behind a selectable object then it was pretty annoying to have to disable that object's type or reposition the editor camera so I can continue to move the sun around.

To balance this out though, the sun is now also deselected when the 'Deselect All' editor hotkey is pressed.
And the sun does still deselect when you double-click select an object, or when you just double-click open space, as it used to before.



Implementation:
In the "void HandleSelect()" function in sky_editor.cpp, there is now an additional param called "stuff_in_the_way", and the sun will only be selected when there is not "stuff_in_the_way".

Whether or not there is "stuff_in_the_way" is determined in map_editor.cpp via the GetSelectableInLineSegment function, which I had the relocate to be above the MapEditor's "void Update()" function so that it can be used there.

And lastly, I just added "sky_editor_->m_sun_selected = false;" in the if-statement where it checks if the 'Deselect All' editor hotkey is pressed.



Reason For Existing:
It sucked to accidently select and possibly edit the sun while it's behind objects.



Testing:
• Tested that the sun indeed cannot be selected when it's behind any enabled selectable object, and that pressing "q" does deselect the sun.

• Tested that if the sun is already selected, that it can still have its position/intensity/colour edited even if it is behind selectable objects.

• Tested that the sun does still correctly deselect when another object is double-click selected, or when double-click is pressed in open space.
